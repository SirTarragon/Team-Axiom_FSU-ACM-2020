Question 7: Bang for your Buck

cart with as many items as possible in 10 mins. At the end of the competition the total value of each cart is
used to determine the winner and this year the prize is a 10 day pass to your favorite mini-golf spot. Since
each person in the competition is required to by in with a $100 donation to the food drive you've deviced a
plan to make sure your family picks you to run and that you'll win.
To practice you've generated a small program that mimics the information processing that you'll need to
perform during the competition. Your program tracks a list of items with their size, represented by area, and
value on a scale of 1 to 100, 1 being the lowest and 100 being the highest. After everything is listed you test
whether you can determine the maximum value given a maximum area of space the items can take up.
Input Description
The number of items will be provided on the first line of input, the second line of input will be a space
separated list of integer values for the items worth, the third line of input will be a space separated list of
integer values representing the items size, and the last line will be the maximum size capacity allowed.
Output Description
Your output should be the maximum value achievable within the maximum area.
