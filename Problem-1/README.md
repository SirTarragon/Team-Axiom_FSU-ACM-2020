# 1 Monster Mash
It’s a monster mash! An absolute graveyard smash! All kinds of monsters – from werewolves to
vampires and witches to ghosts – will be attending! There’s only one problem...how much food
do we need!?!?! These hungry monsters aren’t going to be too happy without good food. Look
the wrong way and they may start nibbling on our human guests. Oh my! Will you help us plan
our party?

There will be 4 types of food: Spooky Cake, Pumpkin Pie, Caramel Apple, Candy Corn. Also,
we are borderline broke... So, we want to order food that will feed as many guests as possible at
a time! This means that foods that can feed more guests have a higher preference. The number
of guests that each food type can feed is listed below:

• Spooky Cake - 9 guests
