• All input is redirected via STDIN.

• All output must be formatted to specification in terms of capitalization and
spacing. Please refer to the example output for each question.

• Do not include a shebang in your submissions.

• Scoring:
– Teams are ranked according to score. A higher score is rewarded by answering more
questions while acquiring fewer penalties.
– The team that solves the greatest number of questions in the quickest time wins.
– Teams which solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time.
– Teams may resubmit solutions as many times as needed, but incorrect submission
attempts will result in time penalties (and thus a lower score.)
– The scoreboard may be accessed during the first four hours of the contest. The
scoreboard will freeze during the final hour.
